How to deal with macOS


# Finder
Download [XtraFinder](https://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/). This will allow normal things like Cut+Paste to work...

# Keyboard Shortcuts
Karabiner Elements

# Cloud Storage

OneDrive's official client is alright, if that's what you wanna use.

# Top Bar
Get [Hidden bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden)
