How to deal with macOS

# Apple shit
Still a WIP. 
## iMessage
You can temporarily (because it automagically comes back it seems) deregister iMessage from the share menu by running `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -R -f -u /System/Applications/Messages.app`. This works on any system. A more permanent solution would be to delete iMessage (or rather, move it to a .dmg so you have a backup). For this, you will need to disable System Integrity Protection.

# SIP
[This tool](https://github.com/fxgst/writeable_root) is pretty useful for mounting rootfs as writable on Big Sur or higher...

# Finder
Download [XtraFinder](https://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/). This will allow normal things like Cut+Paste to work...

# Keyboard Shortcuts
Karabiner Elements

# Cloud Storage
Mountain Duck is honestly your best bet. Google Drive is especially shit, with all the extra unnecessary shortcuts. 
OneDrive's official client is alright, if that's what you wanna use.

# Top Bar
Get [Hidden bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden)

# Alt-Tab (well, âŒ˜-Tab)
Get [Command-Tab Plus](https://noteifyapp.com/command-tab-plus/)

# 7-Zip alternative
Either [The Unarchiver](https://macpaw.com/the-unarchiver) to replace macOS built-in unarchiver, or maybe [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/)

# Clipboard Manager
[Maccy](https://maccy.app/) is FLOSS (download page is pay-what-you-want)
